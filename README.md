Brittany - Advice Threads

# Unit 1

## What This Does

I chose the `advice_threads` corpus, which contains question-and-answer discussions about everyday college experiences. The system can answer questions about topics such as commuting, choosing classes or majors, studying, internships, roommates, campus clubs, and other parts of student life. Because each thread includes several replies with different perspectives, its answers may reflect practical advice and disagreement rather than a single official answer.

## Chunking Strategy

**Chunk size:** 800 characters
**Overlap:** 120 characters

I used 800-character chunks because the advice threads average about 543 characters, so most short threads can stay together while longer discussions can still be split into manageable pieces. The threads contain replies of very uneven length, and useful advice can continue across a boundary, so I used a 120-character overlap to preserve some surrounding context between neighboring chunks. The indexing run produced 26 chunks averaging 487 characters, with the shorter average reflecting the many documents that did not need to fill a complete 800-character window.


## Sample Chunks


**Chunk 1** — source: `thread_bike_commute.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
THREAD: Is a bike worth it for a 20 minute walk commute?

--- reply 1 (14 votes) ---
Yeah. Cuts an 18 minute walk to about 6. The thing nobody mentions is storage — covered bike parking exists at three buildings and is full by 9am at all three.

--- reply 2 (9 votes) ---
Counterpoint, I sold mine. Between November and March the paths are either icy or salted and saltdestroys a drivetrain in one season.

--- reply 3 (22 votes) ---
Both true. I keep a cheap bike for September to November and walk the rest of the year. Total cost was about $120 for the bike and I don't care what happens to it.

--- reply 4 (5 votes) ---
If you do get one, the campus does free registration and it's the only reason I got mine back after it was taken.
```

**Chunk 2** — source: `thread_first_gen.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
THREAD: Anything specific for first-generation students?

--- reply 1 (33 votes) ---
The advising office has a specific programme and it is genuinely good, but it is opt-in and badlypublicised. Ask for it by name.

--- reply 2 (41 votes) ---
The thing I'd say: the unwritten rules are the hard part, not the coursework. Ask about the unwritten rules explicitly. People are happy to explain them and nobody volunteers them.

--- reply 3 (16 votes) ---
Emergency fund for textbooks and travel exists and is not means-tested beyond a short form.
```

**Chunk 3** — source: `thread_laptop_specs.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
THREAD: How much laptop do I actually need for CS courses?

--- reply 1 (31 votes) ---
Less than the recommended spec page says. 16GB of RAM is the one number worth paying for; everything else you'll never notice.

--- reply 2 (18 votes) ---
Adding: the lab machines exist and are better than anything you'll buy. For the heavy assignmentspeople just use those.

--- reply 3 (12 votes) ---
I did two years on an 8GB machine and it was fine until the last project, at which point it very much wasn't. 16 is the answer.
```

**Chunk 4** — source: `thread_office_hours_etiquette.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
THREAD: Is it weird to go to office hours with no specific question?

--- reply 1 (44 votes) ---
No, and this is the single most common thing first years get wrong. 'I'm following the lectures but I don't feel like I understand the shape of it' is a completely normal thing to say.

--- reply 2 (29 votes) ---
They're usually empty. You are doing the instructor a favour by turning up.

--- reply 3 (18 votes) ---
If it helps, treat it as a standing appointment. Go every week for a month and it stops feeling like a thing.
```

**Chunk 5** — source: `thread_roommate_conflict.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
THREAD: Roommate situation isn't working. What now?

--- reply 1 (28 votes) ---
Talk to your RA early, and frame it as 'we need help sorting this out' rather than 'move me'. Room changes are possible but the process starts with mediation and skipping that step slows it down.

--- reply 2 (14 votes) ---
Room changes happen at the semester boundary almost always, and mid-semester only in fairly serious cases.

--- reply 3 (33 votes) ---
Write down specifics before the meeting. 'It's not working' is hard to act on; 'guests four nights a week past 2am' is not.
```

## Sample Answer

**Question:** How much laptop do I actually need for CS courses?

**Answer:** According to `thread_laptop_specs.txt`, you need 16GB of RAM,
which is described as the one number worth paying for. The document also notes
that you need less than what the recommended spec page says, as you will never
notice the other specifications.

```
Source: thread_laptop_specs.txt
```

**My relevance cutoff:**

I set the relevance cutoff to **0.60** in `config.py`. The five in-corpus
questions had best distances from 0.202 to 0.402, while the five out-of-scope
questions ranged from 0.787 to 0.930. This leaves a clear gap between the
closest out-of-scope question and the least similar in-corpus question, so 0.60
should allow relevant advice questions through while refusing unrelated ones.



| Question | In corpus? | Best distance |
|---|---|---|
| Is a bike worth it for a 20 minute walk commute, and what should I do if I get one? | Yes | 0.283 |
| What specific support or advice is available for first-generation students? | Yes | 0.402 |
| How much laptop do I actually need for CS courses? | Yes | 0.202 |
| Is it weird to go to office hours with no specific question? | Yes | 0.384 |
| What should I do if my roommate situation is not working? | Yes | 0.354 |
| What is the capital of Mongolia? | No | 0.890 |
| How do I change the oil in a diesel engine? | No | 0.930 |
| Who won the 1994 World Cup? | No | 0.787 |
| What is the recommended dosage of ibuprofen for a headache? | No | 0.828 |
| How do I write a for loop in Rust? | No | 0.871 |

## How I Used AI

**1.** I asked AI to help write the `split_documents()` chunking function for
the `advice_threads` corpus using 800-character chunks and 120-character
overlap. It suggested a fixed-size sliding-window implementation, which fit
the uneven length of the threads and preserved context across chunk
boundaries. I checked the result by running the chunk command and confirmed it
produced 26 chunks averaging 487 characters, then made sure the chunks were
labeled as produced by `chunker.py::split_documents` so the README matched the
actual function.

**2.** I asked AI to pressure-test my five acceptance criteria and look for
targets that were too vague or difficult to measure. It pointed out that goals
such as “retrieval works” needed specific counts or thresholds, so I kept the
retrieval criterion at 4 of 5 questions, required every answer to name a
source, and added measurable targets for retrieving no more than three chunks
above a 0.70 similarity score and answering at least 4 of 5 questions in three
sentences or fewer. I also added explanations for why each target fit the
advice-thread corpus instead of choosing numbers without connecting them to
the system.

# Unit 2

<!-- These sections get ADDED to what's already above. Don't delete or rewrite
     unit 1 — the point is that someone can see what you said before you knew
     how it went. -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Your five criteria, three runs each. `python run_eval.py --label before`
     runs the questions, puts the OUT_OF_SCOPE ones through the gate, and
     writes it all into results/ for you. Targets come from criteria.md; the
     verdict column is your call.

     Criterion 3 is measured in one deterministic pass rather than three, so
     the same number goes in all three run columns. That's correct, not lazy.

     Milestone 1. -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

<!-- Underneath, paste the REAL output for each criterion from one of your
     runs — the actual text your system produced, not a description of it.
     Name the file and function that produced it. -->

## Verdicts

<!-- MET or MISSED for each of the five, against the target you wrote last
     unit — not a new one. Plus a sentence on how you decided. That sentence
     matters most where it was close.

     If your target said 4 of 5 and your runs came out 4, 3, 4, that's a MISS.
     The target has to hold, not show up occasionally.

     Milestone 2. -->

| # | Criterion | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |

## Diagnoses

<!-- For each miss: which stage caused it, and how. The stage alone isn't
     enough — you need the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis: "Question 3 didn't work."
     A diagnosis:     "Question 3 asks about laundry costs. The answer is in
                       one sentence that got split across two chunks, so
                       neither chunk on its own contains it."

     The five stages: loading → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.

     Look for a pattern. If three misses all ask about numbers, that's one
     problem, not three.

     Missed nothing? Say so, then say honestly whether your targets were set
     low, and which one you'd tighten and to what.

     Milestone 3. -->

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Why I picked it:**

<!-- Connect it to a specific diagnosis above in one sentence. If you can't,
     you picked a fix because it sounded impressive. -->

### Run Log — After

<!-- Same format, same five criteria, three runs each.
     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

**Did it help?**

<!-- Say plainly whether it did, and how you know. If it made things worse,
     say that — a change that backfired, honestly reported, earns full credit
     and is more interesting than one that worked. What matters is that you can
     tell.

     Milestone 4. -->

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed after your fix: what you'd do about it,
     and why you stopped where you did.

     "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is left is
     not.

     Milestone 5. -->

## What I'd Do Differently

<!-- Knowing what you know now — which of your five criteria would you write
     differently, and why?

     Milestone 5. -->
